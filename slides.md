---
# Workshop
:::
<!-- .slide: data-background="url('https://media.giphy.com/media/EMTQ0Y4UgYzKM/giphy.gif') no-repeat" data-background-size="cover" -->
:::
Write down 2 things that impacted your startup:
- One (good) tech choice <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- One fuckup <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
# Product stages ⚠️
:::
- Idea / concept
- Pretotype <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Prototype <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- First version <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

:::
## Why do we use product stages?

- Time to market <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Money (or lack thereof 💸) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Resources (few people got lots done - fast 🏃) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Defines a product that solves a specific problem <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Prevents building a 🚀 before building a 🚲 first <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Helps make good tech & product decisions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Enables rapid development <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Idea / Concept

_Wants vs needs_

:::
What do you need to solve your problem?

*vs.* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->  

What colour should your spaceship be? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

:::
🍷🍻
- Napkin idea <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Prove your concept <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Think about flying to moon 🚀 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

:::
_Ask yourself:_ Are you solving a specific problem?

(or are you building a spaceship 😆) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
# Pretotype

_Test the market_

:::
Pretotyping is using simple tools to collect preliminary data.

_Create and validate your hypothesis_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
:::
- Is there a market for my product?
- Who would use this product?

:::
## Tools 💆‍♂️🙋‍♂️

- Typeform <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Facebook poll <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ASK REAL PEOPLE 👋 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

:::
_Ask yourself:_ Are you solving the problem you intended?

---
# Prototype

_Tests your solution_

:::
A prototype is a _thing_ you can interact with that demonstrates your solution.
:::

## Tools
- Squarespace / WIX <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Static sites <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- 3D printing <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Wordpress <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- InvisionApp <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

:::
_Think:_ What technology do I need to solve this problem?

---
# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

_Tests your product_

:::
An MVP is the simplest version of your product that solves your problem.
:::

## An MVP is about cutting corners
:::

### MVP *hacks*
:::
- Send an email for an order instead of building an ecommerce platform
- Build a simple webpage with an integrated "Buy" button <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

:::
### MVP web *toolbox*
:::
### Web Shops
- Wordpress <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Magento <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Shopify <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
:::
### Use service products (don't reinvent the wheel!)
- Messenger/WhatsApp as a messaging platform <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Intercom <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- more here <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# But sometimes that's not quite enough

# I _need_ an App
:::
## Platforms
- Web <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Native App ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Responsive (progressive) web app ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- API ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- SAAS ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Responsive API SAAS progressively native in the cloud ⚠️⚠️⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# You get all excited
:::

# Then realise you could've built that spaceship faster
:::
_Think_: What *one* platform will test my product on the market

Because you probably don't need more than one. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
:::

## We like web 🌏
- Fast to develop <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Fast to deploy ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Fast to update and iterate <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- All devices have a browser <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Heaps of resources to draw from <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

:::
_Ask yourself:_ Does my minimum product provide a platform where I can validate my hypothesis?
:::

🛑 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

 _Remember:_ Your MVP is just a suggestion of a possible solution. This is your time to test and define the product you need to build. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

👍 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

 _Ask yourself:_ Does this MVP suit the problem and market? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
# First version

_First product ready for market_

:::
The first version is a product you can sell to your target market
:::

# Get to work

Get in groups of three and identify how your startup was affected by your one fuckup and one good tech choice.
