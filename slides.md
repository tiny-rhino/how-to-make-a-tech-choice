# Today's goals
- Understand tech "buzz-words" ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Make "CTO" decisions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
# Workshop
:::
<!-- .slide: data-background="url('https://media.giphy.com/media/EMTQ0Y4UgYzKM/giphy.gif') no-repeat" data-background-size="cover" -->
## Oh shit, you actually have to do something

:::
Write down 2 things that impacted your startup:
- One (good) tech choice <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- One screw up <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
# Product phases ⚠️
- Idea / concept <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Pretotype <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Prototype <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- First version <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

:::
## Why do we use product phases?
- Time to market <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Money (or lack thereof 💸) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Resources (few people to get lots done - fast 🏃) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Derives a product that solves a specific problem <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Prevents building a 🚀 before first building a 🚲 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Assists making good tech decisions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Enables rapid development <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Idea / Concept

_Wants vs needs_

:::
What do you need to solve your problem?

*vs.*

What colour should your spaceship be?

:::
🍷🍻
- Napkin idea
- Prove your concept
- Think about flying to moon 🚀

:::
## Tech Hack - _Know your market_
- Google Trends
- Producthunt.com
- *USE* and understand your competitors tech

:::
_Ask yourself:_ Are you solving a specific problem?

(or are you building a spaceship 😆)

---
# Pretotype

_Test the market_

:::
Pretotyping is using simple tools to collect preliminary data.

_Create and validate your hypothesis_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
:::
👨‍👨‍👧‍👧
- Is there a market for my product?
- Who would use this product?

:::
## Tech Hack 💆‍♂️🙋‍♂️
- Typeform
- Facebook poll
- WIX landing page
- ASK REAL PEOPLE 👋

:::
_Ask yourself:_ Is your audience engaging with your concept?

---
# Prototype

_Tests your solution_

:::
A prototype is a _thing_ you can interact with that demonstrates your solution.

_Think:_ What technology do I need to solve this problem?
:::

## Tech Hacks
- Squarespace / WIX
- Embed Google forms
- InvisionApp
- GitHub pages
- POP - Prototyping on Paper (App)
- Keynote
- Static sites ⚠️
- 3D printing
- Wordpress

:::
# DEMO
:::
<!-- .slide: data-background-iframe="https://tiny-rhino.gitlab.io/ahc-prototype/" data-background-size="cover" data-background="#fff" -->
:::
_Think:_ Should you throw your implementation in the bin?

_Ask yourself:_ Should you throw your *idea* in the bin?

---
# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

_Tests your product_

:::
An MVP is the simplest version of your product that solves your problem.
:::

## MVP corner cutters
- Draw inspiration from (copy 😉) market leaders
- Send an email for an order instead of building an ecommerce platform
- Build a simple webpage with an integrated "Buy" button
- Settle for less (🚲 not 🚀)

:::
## Web Shops Toolbox
- Wordpress
- Magento
- Shopify

:::
## Service products (don't reinvent the wheel!)
- Messenger/WhatsApp as a messaging platform
- Intercom
- fiverr.com
- Upwork.com
- 99designs.dk
- Google apps + Analytics
- Microsoft Azure

# But sometimes that's not quite enough

<!-- .slide: data-background="url('https://media.giphy.com/media/cSozWbWHEfUis/giphy.gif') no-repeat" data-background-size="cover" -->
# I _need_ an App
:::
## Platforms
- Web <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Native App ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Responsive web app ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- API ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- SAAS ⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Responsive API SAAS progressively native in the cloud ⚠️⚠️⚠️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# You get all excited
:::
<!-- .slide: data-background="url('https://media.giphy.com/media/llZ2R6hwJVxWE/giphy.gif') no-repeat" data-background-size="cover" -->
# Then realise you could've built that spaceship faster
:::
_Think_: What *one* platform will test my product on the market

Because you probably don't need more than one.
:::

## We like web 🌏
- Fast to develop
- Fast to deploy ⚠️
- Fast to update and iterate (⏫ features)
- All devices have a browser
- Heaps of resources to draw from
:::

_Remember:_ Your MVP is just a suggestion of a possible solution. This is your time to test and define the product you need to build.

_Ask yourself:_ Does my MVP enable me to validate my hypothesis?

---
# First version

_The child of your MVP iterations_

:::
The first version is a product you can sell to your market

:::
## Tech Consideraitons
- Implement tech that gives your product the edge
- Hire CTO / developer
- Choose a stack ⚠️
- 🚶 > 🛴 > 🚲 > 🚗 > 🚀

_Remember:_ This isn't necessarily your final product. You will iterate and improve based on learnings.

:::
## ⚠️ Tech Considerations ⚠️
- Hosting
- Security
- Privacy
- Programming language
- Framework
- Database

:::
## Tech Hacks
- Azure/AWS - free hosting
- Let's Encrypt - free SSL certificate
- MailJet - free newsletter sending [up to 20.000]
- Zoho - free email hosting for your domain
- GitLab/GitHub pages - free static sites

:::
_Ask yourself:_ Are your tech choices scaleable? Are you ready for success?

_Remember:_ If you crash, it will cost you. Both 💰 and 😎.

# Get to work

Get in groups and identify how your startup was affected by your one screw up and one good tech choice.

- Maybe you iterated on your prototype?
- Maybe you built a 🚀 before picking up a pencil
- Maybe you wasted a week on a feature you didn't need?
- Maybe you could've used a $5 service instead of building your own product?
